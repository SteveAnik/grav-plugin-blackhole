# grav-plugin-blackhole
Why Blackhole? Grav is a space term, so I think this plugin should follow suit. Time stops at the event horizon of a black hole, which is exactly what this plugin does to your website. It freezes it in a state. By Increasing gravity to infinity you get a static black hole, or in this case you generate a static html copy of your Grav website.
